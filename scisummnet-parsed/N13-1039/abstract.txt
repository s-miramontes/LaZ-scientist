author: Online conversational text, typified by microblogs, and text is a challenge for natural language processing. Unlike the highly edited genres that conventional NLP tools have been developed for, conversational text contains many nonstandard lexical items and syntactic patterns. These are the result of unintentional errors, dialectal variation, conversational ellipsis, topic diversity, and creative use of language and orthography (Eisenstein, 2013). An example is shown in Fig. 1. As a result of this widespread variation, standard modeling assumptions that depend on lexical, syntactic, and orthographic regularity are inappropriate. There Abstract We consider the problem of part-of-speech tagging for informal, online conversational text. We systematically evaluate the use of large-scale unsupervised word clustering and new lexical features to improve tagging accuracy. With these features, our system achieves state-of-the-art tagging results on both Twitter and IRC POS tagging tasks; Twitter tagging is improved from 90% to 93% accuracy (more than 3% absolute). Qualitative analysis of these word clusters yields insights about NLP and linguistic phenomena in this genre. Additionally, we contribute the first POS annotation guidelines for such text and release a new dataset of English language tweets annotated using these guidelines. Tagging software, annotation guidelines, and large-scale word clusters are available at:
