In this paper we generalise the sentence compression task. Rather than sim ply shorten a sentence by deleting words or constituents, as in previous work, we rewrite it using additional operations such as substitution, reordering, and insertion. We present a new corpus that is suitedto our task and a discriminative tree-to tree transduction model that can naturallyaccount for structural and lexical mis matches. The model incorporates a novelgrammar extraction method, uses a lan guage model for coherent output, and canbe easily tuned to a wide range of compres sion specific loss functions.
