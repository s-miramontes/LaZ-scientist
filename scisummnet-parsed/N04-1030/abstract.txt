In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for shallow semantic parsing, extend ing the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002),Surdeanu et al (2003) and others. Our al gorithm is based on Support Vector Machineswhich we show give an improvement in performance over earlier classifiers. We show perfor mance improvements through a number of newfeatures and measure their ability to general ize to a new test set drawn from the AQUAINT corpus.
