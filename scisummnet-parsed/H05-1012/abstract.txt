This paper presents a maximum entropyword alignment algorithm for Arabic English based on supervised training data.We demonstrate that it is feasible to create training material for problems in machine translation and that a mixture of su pervised and unsupervised methods yields superior performance. The probabilisticmodel used in the alignment directly models the link decisions. Significant improvement over traditional word alignment tech niques is shown as well as improvement onseveral machine translation tests. Perfor mance of the algorithm is contrasted with human annotation performance.
