This paper presents two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms forBayesian inference of probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) from ter minal strings, providing an alternative to maximum-likelihood estimation usingthe Inside-Outside algorithm. We illus trate these methods by estimating a sparse grammar describing the morphology ofthe Bantu language Sesotho, demonstrat ing that with suitable priors Bayesian techniques can infer linguistic structure in situations where maximum likelihoodmethods such as the Inside-Outside algo rithm only produce a trivial grammar.
