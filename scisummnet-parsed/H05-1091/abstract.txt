We present a novel approach to relation extraction, based on the observation thatthe information required to assert a rela tionship between two named entities in the same sentence is typically capturedby the shortest path between the two entities in the dependency graph. Exper iments on extracting top-level relationsfrom the ACE (Automated Content Ex traction) newspaper corpus show that thenew shortest path dependency kernel outperforms a recent approach based on de pendency tree kernels.
