Introduction. Prel)ositioual phrase attachment disambiguation is a difficult problem. Take, for example, the sen- rouge: ( l ) Buy a ear \[p,o with a steering wheel\]. We would guess that the correct interpretation is that one should buy cars that come with steer- ing wheels, and not that one should use a steering wheel as barter for purchasing a car. \]n this case, we are helped by our world knowledge about auto- mobiles and automobile parts, and about typical methods of barter, which we can draw upon to cor- rectly disambignate he sentence. Beyond possibly needing such rich semantic or conceptual int'ornla- tion, A l tmann and Steedman (AS88) show that there a,re certain cases where a discourse model is needed to correctly disambiguate prepositional phrase atta.chment. However, while there are certainly cases of an> biguity that seem to need some deep knowledge, either linguistic or conceptual, one might ask whag sort of performance could 1oe achieved by a sys- tem thai uses somewhat superficial knowledge au- *Parts of this work done a.t the Computer and hP lbrmation Science Department, University of Penn- sylvania were supported by by DARPA and AFOSR jointly under grant No. AFOSR-90-0066, and by ARO grant No. DAAL 03-89-C0031 PR\[ (first author) and by an IBM gradmtte fellowship (second author).

Recent work has shown thai; this approach olds promise (H\]~,91, HR93). hi this paper we describe a new rule-based ap- proach to prepositional phrase attachment, disam- biguation. A set of silnple rules is learned au- tomatically to try to prediet proper attachment based on any of a number of possible contextual giles. Baseline l l indle and Rooth (IIR91, 1\[17{93) describe corpus-based approach to disambiguating between prepositional phrase attachlnent to the main verb and to the object nonn phrase (such as in the ex- ample sentence above). They first point out that simple attachment s rategies snch as right associa- tion (Kim73) and miuimal a.tbtchment (Fra78) do not work well i,l practice' (see (WFB90)). They then suggest using lexical preference, estimated from a large corpus of text, as a method of re- solving attachment ambiguity, a technique the}' call "lexical association." From a large corpus of pursed text, they first find all nonn phrase heads, and then record the verb (if' any) that precedes the head, and the preposition (if any) that follows it, as well as some other syntactic inforlnation about the sentence. An algorithm is then specified 1,o try to extract attachment information h'om this table of co-occurrences. I!'or instance, a table entry is cousidered a definite instance of the prepositional phrase attaching to the noun if: '\['he noun phrase occm:s in a context where no verb could license the prepositional phrase, specifically if the noun phrase is in a subjeet or other pre-verbal position. They specify seven different procedures for decid- ing whether a table entry is au instance of no attachment, sure noun attach, sm:e verb attach, or all ambiguous attach. Using these procedures, they are able to extract frequency information, 1198 counting t, he numl)e,r of times a ptu:ticular verb or ncmn a.ppe~u:s with a pal:tieuh~r l~reposition. These frequen(;ies erve a.s training d~t;a for the statistical model they use to predict correct i~ttachmenL To dismnbigu;~te s ntence (l), they would compute the likelihood of the preposition with giwm the verb buy, {rod eolltrast that with the likelihood of that preposition given I:he liOttll whed.

The allowable transforlnations are described by the following templates: ? Change the attachment location from X to Y if: - n l i sW - n2 is W - v isW -- p is W - n l is W1 and n2 is W2 - n l i sWl andv isW2 Here "from X to Y" can be either "from nl to v" or "from v to nl ," W (W1, W2, etc.) can be any word, and the ellipsis indicates that the complete set of transformations permits matching on any combination of values for v, n l , p, and n2, with the exception of patterns that specify vahms for all four. For example, one allowable transformation would be Change the attachment location from nl to v if p is "until". Learning proceeds as follows. First, the train- ing set is processed according to the start state annotator, in this case attaching all prepositional phrases low (attached to nl) . Then, in essence, each possible transtbrmation is scored by apply- ing it to the corpus and cornputing the reduction (or increase) in error rate. in reality, the search is data driven, and so the vast majority of al- lowable transformations are not examined. The best-scoring transformation then becomes the first transformation i the learned list. It is applied to the training corpus, and learning continues on the modified corpus. This process is iterated until no rule can he found that reduces the error rate. In the experiment, a tol, al of 471 transfor- mations were learned - - Figure 3 shows the first twenty. 3 Initial accuracy on the test set is 64.0% when prepositional phrases are always attached to the object noun. After applying the transforma- tions, accuracy increases to 80.8%. Figure 2 shows a plot of test-set accuracy as a function of the nulnber of training instances. It is interesting to note that the accuracy curve has not yet, reached a 2If it is the case that attaching to the verb would be a better start state in some corpora, this decision could be parameterized. ZIn transformation #8, word token amount appears because it was used as the head noun for noun phrases representing percentage amounts, e.g. "5%." The rule captures the very regular appearance in the Penn Tree- bank Wall Street Journal corpus of parses like Sales for the yea," \[v'P rose \[Np5Yo\]\[pP in fiscal 1988\]\].

Adding Word Class In format ion In the above experiment, all trans\[brmations are. triggered hy words or groups of words, and it is surprising that good performance is achieved even in spite of the inevitable sparse data problems. There are a number of ways to address the sparse data problem. One of the obvious ways, mapping words to part of speech, seerns unlikely to help. h> stead, semanl, ic class information is an attracLive alternative. We incorporated the idea of using semantic ino tbrmation in the lbllowing way. Using the Word~ Net noun hierarchy (Milg0), each noun in the ffa{ning and test corpus was associated with a set containing the noun itself ph.ts the name of every semantic lass that noun appears in (if any). 4 The transformation template is modified so that in ad- dition to asking if a nmm matches ome word W, 4Class names corresponded to unique "synonynl set" identifiers within the WordNet noun database. A noun "appears in" a class if it falls within the hy- ponym (IS-A) tree below that class.

In order to compare the two approaches, we reimplemen:ed the ~flgorithm fi'om (IIR.91) and tested it using the same training and test set used for the above experiments. Doing so re- sull;ed in an attachment accuracy of 70.4%. Next, the training set was expanded to include not only the cases o\[' ambiguous attachment \]Fonnd in the parsed Wall Street Journal corpus, as before, but also all the unambiguous prepositional phrase at- tachments tbnnd in the corpus, as well (contiml- ing to exclnde the tesl, set, of course). Accuracy improved to 75.8% r using the larger training set, still significantly lower than accuracy obtained us-- lag tam tl:ansformal;ion-based approach. The t.ech- nique described in (Res93b, 1{1t93), which com- bined Hindle and Rooth's lexical association tech- nique with a WordNet-based conceptual associa- tion measure, resulted in an accuracy of 76.0%, also lower than the results obtained using trans- formations. Since llindle and Rooth's approach does not make reference to n2, we re-ran the transformation-learner disalk)wing all transforma- tions that make reference ~o n2. Doing so resulted in an accuracy of 79.2%. See figure 5 h)r a sun> mary of results. It is possihle Lo compare; the results described here with a somewhat similar approach devel-. oped independently by Ratnaparkhi and I/,oukos (l{R94), since they also used training and test datt~ drawn from the Penn Treebank's Wall Street Jour- nal corpus. Instead of' using mammlly coustructed lexical classes, they nse word classes arrived at via mutmd information clustering in a training corpus (BDd+92), resulting in a representation i which each word is represented by a sequence of bits. As in the experiments here, their statistical model also makes use of a 4-tuple context (v, c<l, p, n2), and can use the identit.ies of the words, class inl'or- marion (tbr them, wdues of any of the class bits), rThe difference between these results ~nd tile result they quoted is likely due to a much bLrger training set used in their origimd experiments. 1202 or both Mnds of i ld'ormation as eotll;extual fea- tlll?eS riley {lescril)e a search process use(\[ to {letePn6\]m what, sul)set of the available ill\['or,~Ht- l ion will Im used in the model.
