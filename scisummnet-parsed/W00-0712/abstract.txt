Morphology induction is a subproblem of important tasks like automatic learning of machine-readable dictionaries and grammar induction. Previous morphology induction approaches have relied solely on statistics of hypothesized stems and affixes to choose which affixes to consider legitimate. Relying on stemand-affix statistics rather than semantic knowledge leads to a number of problems, such as the inappropriate use of valid affixes (&quot;ally&quot; stemming to &quot;all&quot;). We introduce a semantic-based algorithm for learning morphology which only proposes affixes when the stem and stem-plusaffix are sufficiently similar semantically. We implement our approach using Latent Semantic Analysis and show that our semantics-only approach provides morphology induction results that rival a current state-of-the-art system.
