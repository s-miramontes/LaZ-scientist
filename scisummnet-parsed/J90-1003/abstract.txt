1982) for constructing language models for applications in speech recognition. 2. Smadja (in press) discusses the separation between collocates in a very similar way. This definition y) a rectangular window. It might be interesting to consider alternatives (e.g. a triangular window or a decaying exponential) that would weight words less and less as they are separated by more and more words. Other windows are also possible. For example, Hindle (Church et al. 1989) has used a syntactic parser to select words in certain constructions of interest. 4. Although the Good-Turing Method (Good 1953) is more than 35 years old, it is still heavily cited. For example, Katz (1987) uses the in order to estimate trigram probabilities in the recognizer. The Good-Turing Method is helpful for trigrams that have not been seen very often in the training corpus. The last unclassified line, . . . shoppers anywhere from $50 . . . raises interesting problems. Syntactic &quot;chunking&quot; shows that, in spite its co-occurrence of line does not belong here. An intriguing exercise, given the lookup table we are trying construct, is how to guard against false inferences such as that since tagged [PERSON], here count as either a LOCATION. Accidental coincidences of this kind do not have a significant effect on the measure, however, although they do serve as a reminder of the probabilistic nature of the findings. The word also occurs significantly in the table, but on closer it is clear that this use of to time) as something like a commodity or resource, not as part of a time adjunct. Such are the pitfalls of lexicography (obvious when they are pointed out).
