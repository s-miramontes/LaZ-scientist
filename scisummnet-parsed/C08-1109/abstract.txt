In this paper we describe a methodologyfor detecting preposition errors in the writ ing of non-native English speakers. Our system performs at 84% precision andclose to 19% recall on a large set of stu dent essays. In addition, we address the problem of annotation and evaluation inthis domain by showing how current ap proaches of using only one rater can skew system evaluation. We present a sampling approach to circumvent some of the issuesthat complicate evaluation of error detec tion systems.
