In this paper, we propose an approach toautomatically detect sentiments on Twit ter messages (tweets) that explores some characteristics of how tweets are written and meta-information of the words that compose these messages. Moreover, we leverage sources of noisy labels as our training data. These noisy labels were provided by a few sentiment detectionwebsites over twitter data. In our experi ments, we show that since our features areable to capture a more abstract representation of tweets, our solution is more ef fective than previous ones and also more robust regarding biased and noisy data, which is the kind of data provided by these sources.
