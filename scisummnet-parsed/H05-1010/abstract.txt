We present a discriminative, large margin approach to feature-based matching for word alignment. In thisframework, pairs of word tokens re ceive a matching score, which is basedon features of that pair, including mea sures of association between the words,distortion between their positions, sim ilarity of the orthographic form, and soon. Even with only 100 labeled train ing examples and simple features whichincorporate counts from a large unlabeled corpus, we achieve AER perfor mance close to IBM Model 4, in muchless time. Including Model 4 predic tions as features, we achieve a relativeAER reduction of 22% in over inter sected Model 4 alignments.
