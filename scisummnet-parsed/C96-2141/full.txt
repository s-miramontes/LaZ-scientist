Introduction. In this paper, we address the problem of word alignments for a bilingual corpus. In the recent years, there have been a number of papers con- sidering this or similar problems: (Brown et al, 1990), (Dagan et al, 1993), (Kay et al, 1993), (Fung et al, 1993). In our approach, we use a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) (aelinek, 1976), which is similar, but not identical to those used in speech recognition. The key component of this approach is to make the alignment probabilities dependent not on the absolute position of the word align- ment, but on its relative position; i.e. we consider the differences in the index of the word positions rather than the index itself. The organization of the paper is as follows. After reviewing the statistical approach to ma- chine translation, we first describe the convention- al model (mixture model). We then present our first-order HMM approach in lull detail. Finally we present some experimental results and compare our model with the conventional model.
Review: Translation Model. . The goal is the translation of a text given in some language F into a target language E. For conve- nience, we choose for the following exposition as language pair French and English, i.e. we are giv- en a French string f~ = fx ...fj...fJ, which is to be translated into an English string e / = el...ei...cl. Among all possible English strings, we will choose the one with the highest probability which is given by Bayes' decision rule: a{ = argmax{P,.(c{lAa)} q = argmax {Pr(ejt) . l ' r ( f  le\[)} el ~ Pr(e{) is the language model of the target lan- guage, whereas Pr(fJle{) is the string translation model. The argmax operation denotes the search problem. In this paper, we address the problem of introducing structures into the probabilistic de- pendencies in order to model the string translation probability Pr(f~ le{).
Al ignment Models. . A key issne in modeling the string translation probability Pr(J'~le I) is the question of how we define the correspondence b tween the words of the English sentence and the words of the French sentence. In typical cases, we can assume a sort of pairwise dependence by considering all word pairs (fj, ei) for a given sentence pair I.-/1\[~'J', elqlj' We fur- ther constrain this model by assigning each French word to exactly one English word. Models describ- ing these types of dependencies are referred to as alignment models. In this section, we describe two models for word alignrnent in detail: ,. a mixture-based alignment model, which was introduced in (Brown et al, 1990); ? an HMM-based alignment model. In this paper, we address the question of how to define specific models for the alignment probabil- ities. The notational convention will be as fol- lows. We use the symbol Pr(.) to denote general 836 probability distributions with (nearly) no Sl)eeitic asSUml)tions. In contrast, for modcl-t)ased prol)-- ability distributions, we use the generic symbol v(.). 3.1 Al ignment w i th M ix ture D is t r i |mt ion. Here, we describe the mixture-based alignment model in a fornmlation which is different fronl the original formulation ill (Brown el, a\[., 1990). We will ,is(: this model as reference tbr the IIMM- based alignments to lie 1)resented later. The model is based on a decomposition of the joint probability \[br ,l'~ into a product over the probabilities for each word J): a j=l wheFe~ fo\[' norll-la\]iz;i, t on 17(~/SOllS~ the 8elltC\]\[ce length probability p(J\] l) has been included. The next step now is to assutne a sort O\['l,airwise inter- act, ion between tim French word f j an(l each, F,n- glish word ci, i = 1, ... l . These dep('ndencies are captured in the lbrm of a rnixtnre distritmtion: 1 p(J)le{) = ~_.p(i, fjlc I) i=1 I = ~_~p(ilj, l).p(fjle~) i=1 Putting everything together, we have the following mixture-based ntodel: J l r,'(fi!l~I) = p(JIO ' H ~_~ \[~,(ilJ, l). ~,(j)led\] (1) j= l i=t with the following ingredients: ? sentence length prob~d)ility: P(J l l); ? mixture alignment probability: p( i l j , I); ? translation probM)ility: p(f\[e). Assuming a tmifornl ~flignment prol)ability 1 .p(ilj, 1) = 7 we arrive at the lh'st model proposed t)y (Brown et al, 1990). This model will be referred to as IB M 1 model. To train the translation probabilities p(J'fc), we use a bilingual (;orpus consisting of sentence pairs \[:/ ';4"1 : ', . , s Using the ,,laxin,ul , like- lihood criterion, we ol)tain the following iterative L a equation (Brown et al, 1990): / ) ( f ie) = ~ - will, $' A(f,e) = ~ 2 ~5(f,J).~) }~ a(e,e~.~) For unilbrm alignment probabilities, it can be shown (Brown et al, 1990), that there is only one optinnnn and therefore the I,',M algorithm (Baum, 1!)72) always tinds the global optimum. For mixture alignment model with nonunilbrm alignment probabilities (subsequently referred to as IBM2 model), there ~tre to() many alignrnent parameters Pill j , I) to be estimated for smMl co l pora. Therefore, a specific model tbr tile Mign- ment in:obabilities i used: r ( i - j~- ) (~) p( i l j , 1) = l . I E i ' : l "( it --" J J-) This model assumes that the position distance rel- ative to the diagonal ine of the (j, i) plane is the dominating factor (see Fig. 1). 'lb train this mod- el, we use the ,naximutn likelihood criterion in the so-called ulaximmn al)proximation, i.e. the likeli- hood criterion covers only tile most lik(-.ly align: inch, rather than the set of all alignm(,nts: d P,'(f(I,:I) ~ I I ~"IU HO, ~)v(J} I,:~)\] (a) j=l In training, this criterion amounts to a sequence of iterations, each of which consists of two steps: * posi l ion al ignmcnl: (riven the model parame- ters, deLerlniim the mosL likely position align- \]lient. paramc, lcr cst imal ion: Given the position alignment, i.e. goiug along the alignment paths for all sentence pairs, perform maxi- tnulu likelihood estimation of the model pa- rameters; for model-De(' distributions, these estimates result in relative frequencies. l)ue to the natnre of tile nfixture tnod(:l, there is no interaction between d jacent word positions. Theretbre, the optimal position i for each posi- tion j can be determined in(lependently of the neighbouring positions. Thus l.he resulting train- ing procedure is straightforward. a.2 Al ignment w i th HMM We now propose all HMM-based alignment model. '\['he motivation is that typicMly we have a strong localization effect in aligning the words in parallel texts (for language pairs fi:om \]ndoeuropean lan- guages): the words are not distrilmted arbitrarily over the senteuce \])ositions, but tend to form clus- ters. Fig. 1 illustrates this effect for the language pair German- 15'nglish. Each word of the German sentence is assigned to a word of the English sentence. The alignments have a strong tendency to preserve the local neigh- borhood when going from the one langnage to the other language. In mm,y cases, although not al~ ways, there is an even stronger restriction: the differeuce in the position index is smMler than 3. 837 DAYS BOTH ON EIGHT AT IT MAKE CAN WE IF THINK I WELL + + + + + + + + +j~ + + + + + + + + + ~J ~+ + +++++++/+?+. - . + + + + + + +/+ + + + + + + + + + ~x~ + + + + + + + + + +/+ D + + + + + ++ + + ~ + + + + + + + + + + _~ + + + + + + + + + +~ + + ++ ++++ + +jg + + + + + + + + + +~ +++ + + + + + + + g + + ++ + ++ + + + + z aa Figure 1: Word alignment for a German- English sentence pair. To describe these word-by-word aligmnents, we introduce the mapping j ---+ aj, which assigns a word f j in position j to a word el in position { = aj. The concept of these alignments i similar to the ones introduced by (Brown et al, 1990), but we wilt use another type of dependence in the probability distributions. Looking at such align- ments produced by a hmnan expert, it is evident that the mathematical model should try to cap- ture the strong dependence of aj on the previous aligmnent. Therefore the probability of alignment aj for position j should have a dependence on the previous alignment aj _ 1 : p(a j ia j_ l , i ) , where we have inchided the conditioning on the total length \[ of the English sentence for normal- ization reasons. A sinfilar approach as been cho- sen by (Da.gan et al, 1993). Thus the problem formulation is similar to that of the time align- ment problem in speech recognition, where the so-called IIidden Markov models have been suc- cessfully used for a long time (Jelinek, 1976). Us- ing the same basic principles, we can rewrite the probability by introducing the 'hidden' alignments af := al. . .aj . . .aa for a sentence pair If,a; e{\]: Pr(f~al es) = ~_,Vr(fal, aT\[ eI't, a7 ,1 = ~ 1-IP"(k,"stfT-',"{ -*,e/) a I j=l So far there has been no basic restriction of the approach. We now assume a first-order depen- dence on the alignments aj only: Vr(fj,aslf{ -~, J-* a I , e l ) where, in addition, we have assmned that tile translation probability del)ends only oil aj and not oil aj-:l. Putting everything together, we have the ibllowing llMM-based model: a Pr(f:i'le{) = ~ I-I \[p(ajlaj - ' , l).p(Y)lea,)\] (4) af J=, with the following ingredients: ? IlMM alignment probability: p(i\]i', I) or p(a j la j _ l , I ) ; ? translation probabflity: p(f\]e). In addition, we assume that the t{MM align- ment probabilities p(i\[i', \[) depend only on the jump width (i - i'). Using a set of non-negative parameters {s ( i - i')}, we can write the IIMM alignment probabilities in the form: 4 i - i') (5) p(ili', i ) = E ' s(1 - i') 1=1 This form ensures that for each word position i', i' = 1, ..., I, the ItMM alignment probabilities satisfy the normMization constraint. Note the similarity between Equations (2) and (5). The mixtm;e model can be interpreted as a zeroth-order model in contrast to the first-order tlMM model. As with the IBM2 model, we use again the max- imum approximation: J Pr(fiSle~) "~ max\]--\[ \[p(asl<*j-1, z)p(fj l<~,)\] (6) a ' / .ll. j,,, j= l In th is case, the task o f f ind ing the opt ima l alignment is more involved than in the case of the mixture model (lBM2). Thereibre, we have to re- sort to dynainic programming for which we have the following typical reeursion formula: Q(i, j ) = p(f j lel) ,nvax \[p(ili', 1) . Q(i', j - 1)\] i =l , . , , I Here, Q(i, j ) is a sort of partial probability as in time alignment for speech recognition (Jelinek, 197@. The models were tested on several tasks: ? the Avalanche Bulletins published by the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SHSAR) in Davos, Switzerland and made awtilable by the Eu- p "q I ropean Corpus Initiative (I,CI/MCI, 1994); ? the Verbmobil Corpus consisting of sponta- neously spoken dialogs in the domain of ap- pointment scheduling (Wahlster, 1993); 838 ,, the EuTrans C, orpus which contains tyl)ical phrases from the tourists and t.ravel docnain.

A pro- nounced example is given in Figure 2. 'She prob- lem of the absolute position alignment can he demonstrated at the positions (a) and (c): both Schneebretlgefahr und Schneeverfrachtungen have a high probability on neige. The IBM2 models chooses the position near the diagonal, as this is the one with the higher probability. Again, Schneebrettgefahr generates de which explains the wrong alignment near the diagonal in (c). However, this strength of the HMM model can also be a weakness as in the case of est developpe ist ... entstanden (see (b) in Figure 2. The required two large jumps are correctly found by the mixture model, but not by the HMM mod- el. These cases suggest an extention to the HMM model. In general, there are only a small number of big jumps in the position alignments in a given sentence pair. Therefore a model could be useful that distinguishes between local and big jumps. The models have also been tested on the Verb- mobil Translation Corpus as well as on a small Corpus used in the EuTrans project. The sen- tences in the EuTrans corpus are in general short phrases with simple grammatical structures. However, the training corpus is very small and the produced alignments are generally of poor quality. There is no marked difference for the two align- ment models.

The assumption that every word in the source language is aligned to a word in the target language breaks down for many sentence pairs, resulting in poor alignment. This in turn affects the quality of the translation probabilities. Several extensions to the current IIMM based model could be used to tackle these problems: * The results presented here did not use the concept of the empty word. For the HMM- based model this, however, requires a second- order rather than a first-order model. We could allow for multi-word phrases in. both languages. In addition to the absolute or relative align- ment positions, the alignment probabilities can be assumed to depend on part of speech tags or on the words themselves. (confer model 4 in (Brown et al, 1990)). 5 Conclusion. In this paper, we have presented an itMM-based approach for rnodelling word aligmnents in par- allel texts. The characteristic feature of this ap- proach is to make the alignment probabilities ex- plicitly dependent on the alignment position of the previous word. We have tested the model suc- cessfully on real data. The HMM-based approach produces translation probabilities comparable to the mixture alignment model. When looking at the position alignments those generated by the ItMM model are in general much smoother. This could be especially helpful for languages uch as German, where compound words are matched to several words in the source language. On the oth- er hand, large jumps due to different word order- ings in the two languages are successfully modeled. We are presently studying and testing a nmltilevel HMM model that allows only a small number of large jumps. The ultimate test of the different alignment and translation models can only be car- ried out in the framework of a fully operational translation system. 6 Acknowledgement.
