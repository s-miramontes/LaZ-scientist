This paper investigates two elements of Maximum Entropy tagging: the use of a correction feature in the Generalised Iterative Scaling (Gis) estimation algorithm, and techniques for model smoothing. We show analytically and empirically that the correction feature, assumed to be required for the correctof unnecessary. We also explore the use of a Gaussian prior and a simple cutoff for smoothing. The experiments are performed with two tagsets: standard Penn Treebank and the larger set of lexical types from
