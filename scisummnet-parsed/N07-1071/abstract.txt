Semantic inference is a key component for advanced natural language understanding. However, existing collections of automatically acquired inference rules have shown disappointing results when used in applications such as textual entailment and question answering. This papresents a collection of methods for automatically learning admissible argument values to which an inference rule be applied, which we call and methods for filtering out incorrect inferences. We present empirical evidence of its effectiveness.
