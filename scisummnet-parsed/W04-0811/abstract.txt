In fact, all of the seven systems reported as supervised scored higher than any of the nine systems reported as unsupervised in both precision and recall (using either of the two scoring criteria). The greatest difference between these results those of the all-words task is that a greater number of systems have now achieved scores at or above the baseline. While this result is encouraging, it seems that the best systems have a hit a wall in the 65- 70% range. This is not surprising given the typical inter-annotator agreement of 70-75% for this task. We believe that further significant progress must await the development of resources with coarser-grained sense distinctions and with glosses that draw explicit contrasts between the senses — resources more suitable for the task at hand.
