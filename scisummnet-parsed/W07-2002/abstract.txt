The goal of this task is to allow for comparison across sense-induction and discrim ination systems, and also to compare thesesystems to other supervised and knowledgebased systems. In total there were 6 participating systems. We reused the SemEval 2007 English lexical sample subtask of task17, and set up both clustering-style unsuper vised evaluation (using OntoNotes senses as gold-standard) and a supervised evaluation (using the part of the dataset for mapping). We provide a comparison to the results ofthe systems participating in the lexical sam ple subtask of task 17.
