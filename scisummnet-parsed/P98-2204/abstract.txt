I propose a model for determining the hearer's attentional state which depends solely on a list of salient discourse entities (S-list). The ordering among the elements of the S-list covers also the of the center the centering model. The ranking criteria for the S-list based on the distinction between entities and incorporate preferences for interand intra-sentential anaphora. The model is the basis for an algorithm which operates incrementally, word by word.
