This paper compares a number of generative probability models for a widecoverage Combinatory Categorial Gram mar (CCG) parser. These models are trained and tested on a corpus obtained by translating the Penn Treebank trees into CCG normal-form derivations. According to an evaluation of unlabeled word-word dependencies, our best model achieves a performance of 89.9%, comparable to thefigures given by Collins (1999) for a lin guistically less expressive grammar. Incontrast to Gildea (2001), we find a significant improvement from modeling word word dependencies.
