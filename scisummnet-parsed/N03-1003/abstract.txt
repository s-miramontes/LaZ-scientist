We address the text-to-text generation problem of sentence-level paraphrasing â€” a phenomenon distinct from and more difficult than wordor phrase-level paraphrasing. Our apapplies alignment sentences gathered from unannotated comparable corpora: it learns a set of paraphrasing patrepresented by lattice and automatically determines how to apply these patterns to rewrite new sentences. The results of our evaluation experiments show that the system derives accurate paraphrases, outperforming baseline systems.
