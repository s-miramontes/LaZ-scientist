This paper describes and evaluates log-linear parsing models for Combinatory Categorial A parallel implementation of algorithm is described, which runs on a Beowulf cluster allowing the complete Penn Treebank to be used for estimation. We also develop a new efficient parsing for maximises expected recall of dependencies. We compare models use all including nonstandard derivations, with normal-form models. The performances of the two models are comparable and the results are competitive with ex
