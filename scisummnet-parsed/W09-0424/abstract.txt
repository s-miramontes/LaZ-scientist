describe an open source toolkit for statistical machine translation. Joshua implements all of the algorithms required for synchronous context grammars (SCFGs): chart-parsing, gram language model integration, beamcube-pruning, and extraction. The toolkit also implements suffix-array grammar extraction and minimum error rate training. It uses parallel and distributed computing techniques for scalability. We demonstrate that the toolkit achieves state of the art translation performance on the WMT09 French-English translation task.
