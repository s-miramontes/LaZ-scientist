Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG) supertags present phrase-based machine translation with an opportunity to access rich syntactic information at a word level.The challenge is incorporating this informa tion into the translation process. Factoredtranslation models allow the inclusion of supertags as a factor in the source or target language. We show that this results in an im provement in the quality of translation and that the value of syntactic supertags in flat structured phrase-based models is largely due to better local reorderings.
