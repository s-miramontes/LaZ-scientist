We present a new approach for mappingnatural language sentences to their formal meaning representations using string kernel-based classifiers. Our system learns these classifiers for every production in theformal language grammar. Meaning representations for novel natural language sen tences are obtained by finding the most probable semantic parse using these stringclassifiers. Our experiments on two real world data sets show that this approachcompares favorably to other existing sys tems and is particularly robust to noise.
