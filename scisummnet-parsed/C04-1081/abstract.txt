Chinese word segmentation is a difficult, im portant and widely-studied sequence modelingproblem. This paper demonstrates the abil ity of linear-chain conditional random fields(CRFs) to perform robust and accurate Chinese word segmentation by providing a principled framework that easily supports the in tegration of domain knowledge in the form of multiple lexicons of characters and words. We also present a probabilistic new word detection method, which further improves performance. Our system is evaluated on four datasets usedin a recent comprehensive Chinese word segmentation competition. State-of-the-art perfor mance is obtained.
