We present a statistical phrase-based translamodel that uses phrases that contain subphrases. The model is formally a synchronous context-free grammar but is learned from a bitext without any syntactic information. Thus it can be seen as shift to the of syntaxtranslation systems without any lin- In our experiments using BLEU as a metric, the hierarchical phrasebased model achieves a relative improvement of 7.5% over Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system.
