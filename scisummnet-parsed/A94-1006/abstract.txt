How would Microsoft, or some other software vendor, want the term &quot;Character menu&quot; to be translated in their manuals?

In many cases, there may be a number of acceptable translations, but it is important for the sake of consistency to standardize on a single one. It would be unacceptable for a manual to use a variety of synonyms for a particular menu or button. Customarily, translation houses make extensive job-specific glossaries to ensure consistency and correctness of technical terminology for large jobs. A glossary is a list of terms and their translations.' We will subdivide the task of constructing a glossary into two subtasks: (1) generating a list of terms, and (2) finding the translation equivalents. The first task will be referred to as the monolingual task and the second as the bilingual task. How should a glossary be constructed? Translation schools teach their students to read as much background material as possible in both the source and target languages, an extremely time-consuming
