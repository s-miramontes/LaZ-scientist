We discuss the relevance of k-best parsing torecent applications in natural language pro cessing, and develop efficient algorithms for k-best trees in the framework of hypergraphparsing. To demonstrate the efficiency, scal ability and accuracy of these algorithms, we present experiments on Bikel?s implementation of Collins? lexicalized PCFG model, and on Chiang?s CFG-based decoder for hierarchicalphrase-based translation. We show in particu lar how the improved output of our algorithms has the potential to improve results from parse reranking systems and other applications.
