We present two language models based upon an “immediate-head” parser — our name for a parser that conditions events below a constituent head of While all of the most accurate statistical parsers are of the immediate-head variety, no previous grammatical language model uses this technology. The perplexity for both of these models significantly improve upon the trigram model base-line as well as the best previous grammarbased language model. For the better of our two models these improvements are 24% and 14% respectively. We also suggest that improvement of the underlying parser should significantly improve the model’s perplexity and that even in the near term there is a lot of potential for improvement in immediatehead language models. are what we will call parsers in that all of the properties of the immedescendants of a constituent assigned probabilities that are conditioned on the lexical of For example, in Figure 1 the probability the into np pp conditioned on head of the “put”, as are the choices of the under the i.e., “ball” (the head of and “in” (the head of the It is the experience of the statistical parsing community that immediate-head parsers are the most accurate we can design. It is also worthy of note that many of these [1,3,6,7] are that is, for a try to find the parse by Equation 1: = arg (1) This is interesting because insofar as they comthese parsers define a language-model in that they can (in principle) assign a probability to all possible sentences in the language by com
