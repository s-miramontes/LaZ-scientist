We show for the first time that incorporatingthe predictions of a word sense disambigua tion system within a typical phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) model consistently improves translation qualityacross all three different IWSLT ChineseEnglish test sets, as well as producing sta tistically significant improvements on the larger NIST Chinese-English MT task? and moreover never hurts performance on any test set, according not only to BLEUbut to all eight most commonly used au tomatic evaluation metrics. Recent work has challenged the assumption that word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems areuseful for SMT. Yet SMT translation qual ity still obviously suffers from inaccurate lexical choice. In this paper, we addressthis problem by investigating a new strategy for integrating WSD into an SMT sys tem, that performs fully phrasal multi-worddisambiguation. Instead of directly incor porating a Senseval-style WSD system, weredefine the WSD task to match the ex act same phrasal translation disambiguation task faced by phrase-based SMT systems.Our results provide the first known empirical evidence that lexical semantics are in deed useful for SMT, despite claims to the contrary. ?This material is based upon work supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under GALE Contract No. HR0011-06-C-0023, and by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC) research grants
