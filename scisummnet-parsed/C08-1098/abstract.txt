We present a HMM part-of-speech tag ging method which is particularly suited for POS tagsets with a large number of fine-grained tags. It is based on three ideas: (1) splitting of the POS tags into attributevectors and decomposition of the contex tual POS probabilities of the HMM into aproduct of attribute probabilities, (2) esti mation of the contextual probabilities with decision trees, and (3) use of high-order HMMs. In experiments on German andCzech data, our tagger outperformed state of-the-art POS taggers.
