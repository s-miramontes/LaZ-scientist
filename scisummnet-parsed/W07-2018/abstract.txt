This task consists of recognizing words and phrases that evoke semantic frames as defined in the FrameNet project (http: //framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu), and their semantic dependents, which are usually, but not always, their syntacticdependents (including subjects). The train ing data was FN annotated sentences. In testing, participants automatically annotated three previously unseen texts to match goldstandard (human) annotation, including pre dicting previously unseen frames and roles. Precision and recall were measured both for matching of labels of frames and FEs and for matching of semantic dependency trees based on the annotation.
