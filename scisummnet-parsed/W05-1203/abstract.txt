This paper presents a knowledge-based method for measuring the semanticsimilarity of texts. While there is a large body of previous work focused on finding the semantic similarity of concepts and words, the application of these wordoriented methods to text similarity has not been yet explored. In this paper, we introduce a method that combines wordto-word similarity metrics into a text-totext metric, and we show that this method outperforms the traditional text similarity metrics based on lexical matching.
