We present an extension of phrase-based statistical machine translation models that enables the straight-forward integration of additional annotation at the word-level ?may it be linguistic markup or automatically generated word classes. In a num ber of experiments we show that factoredtranslation models lead to better translation performance, both in terms of auto matic scores, as well as more grammatical coherence.
