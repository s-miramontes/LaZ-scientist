We present a system for the semantic role la beling task. The system combines a machine learning technique with an inference procedurebased on integer linear programming that supports the incorporation of linguistic and struc tural constraints into the decision process. Thesystem is tested on the data provided in CoNLL 2004 shared task on semantic role labeling and achieves very competitive results.
