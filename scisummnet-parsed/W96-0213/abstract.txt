This paper presents a statistical model which trains from a corpus annotated with Part-Of- Speech tags and assigns them to previously unseen text with state-of-the-art accuracy(96.6%). The can be classified as a Entropy model and simultaneously uses many contextual &quot;features&quot; to predict the POS tag. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates the use of specialized features to model difficult tagging decisions, discusses the corpus consistency problems discovered during the implementation of these features, and proposes a training strategy that mitigates these problems.
