6: Multipath Translation Induction language word), so the system's performance is lower than the Section 3 results. Since all available dictionaries are incomplete, it is difficult to decide which set of English words to compare against. Table 6 presents results for different choices of word coverage: the subset of existing pairs for English-Spanish, the union over all languages, and the intersection of all languages. Trends across subsets are relatively consistent. As an illustration, Table 7 shows consensus formation on English-Norweigian and English-Portuguese translation mappings via multiple bridge languages. Note that the English-French dictionary used here has no entry for &quot;bait&quot;, preventing its use as a bridge language for this word. As can be seen in Table 6, the distance-based combination methods are more successful at combining the different proposals than the rank-N combinations. One possible explanation for this is that rankbased classifiers pick the candidate with the best allaround distance, while distance-based combinations choose the single best candidate. Choosing the best all-around performer is detrimental when cognates exist for some languages but not for others.

Results for such oracles are also reported in Table 6. The methods corresponding to &quot;oracle-1&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; are choosing from the same set of proposed targets, and the &quot;distance&quot; method achieves performance close to that of the oracle (77 vs. 82.8). 6 Path Differences This section investigates the effect of different pathway configurations on the performance of the final multi-path system by examining the following situations: • English to Portuguese, using the other Romance languages as bridges. • English to Norwegian, using the Germanic languages as bridges. • English to Ukrainian, using the Slavic languages as bridges. • Portuguese to English, using the Germanic languages and French as bridges. The results of these experiments are shown in Taen=English, pt=Portuguese, fr=French, it=Italian, es=Spanish, ro=Romanian, du=Dutch, no=Norwegian, de=German, da=Danish, cz=Czech, uk=Ukrainian, po=Polish, sr=Serbian, ru=Russian The data sets used in these experiments were apthe same size as those used in the previous experiment 1100-1300 translation word Dictionaries for Russian and Ukrainian were converted into romanized pronunciation dictionaries. There are three observations which can be made from the multipath results. 1. Adding more pathways usually results in an accuracy improvement. When there is a drop in accuracy on the cognate vocabulary by adding an additional bridge language there tends to be an improvement in accuracy on the full vocabulary due to significantly more cognate pathways (yielding greater coverage). 2. It is difficult to substantially improve upon the performance of the single closest bridge language, especially when they are as close as enes-pt. Improvements on performance relative to the single best ranged from 2% to 20%. 3. Several mediocre pathways can be combined to improve performance. Though it is always better to find one high-performing pathway, it is often possible to get good performance from the combination of several, less well-performing pathways (e.g. en-[sr po]-uk vs. en-ru-uk). In Table 8 &quot;Cvg&quot; or cognate coverage is the percentage words in the source language for which any of the bridge languages contains a cognate to the target translation. Italian and French bridges, for example, offer additional translation pathways to Portuguese which augment the Spanish pathways.

As a final note, Table 9 shows the cross-language translation rates for some of the investigated languages. When translating from English to one of the Romance languages, using Spanish as the bridge language achieves the highest accuracy; and using Russian as the bridge language achieves the best performance when translating from English to the Slavic languages. However, note that using English alone without a bridge language when translating to the Romance languages still achieves reasonable performance, due to the substantial French and Latinate presence in English vocabulary. 7 Related Work Probabilistic string edit distance learning techniques have been studied by Ristad and Yianilos (1998) for use in pronunciation modeling for speech recognition. Satta and Henderson (1997) propose a transformation learning method for generic string transduction. Brill and Moore (2000) propose an alternative string distance metric and learning algorithm. While early statistical machine translation models, such as Brown et al. (1993), did not use any cognate based information to seed their wordto-word translation probabilities, subsequent models (Chen, 1993 and Simard et al., 1992) incorporated some simple deterministic heuristics to increase the translation model probabilities for cognates. Other methods have been demonstrated for building bilingual dictionaries using simple heuristic rules includes Kirschner (1982) for English/Czech dictionaries and Chen (1998) for Chinese/English proper names. Tiedemann (1999) improves on these alignment seedings by learning all-or-nothing rules for detecting Swedish/English cognates. Hajie et al. (2000) has studied the exploitation of language similarity for use in machine translation in the case of the very closely related languages (Czech/Slovak). Covington (1998) uses an algorithm based on heuristic orthographic changes to find cognate words for purposes of historical comparison. Perhaps the most comprehensive study of word alignment via string transduction methods was pioneered by Knight and Graehl (1998). While restricted to single language transliteration, it very effectively used intermediary phonological models to bridge direct lexical borrowing across distant languages. 8 Conclusion The experiments reported in this paper extend prior research in a number of directions. The novel probabilistic paradigm for inducing translation lexicons for words from unaligned word lists is introduced. The set of languages on which we demonstrate these methods is broader than previously examined. Finally, the use of multiple bridge languages and of the high degree of intra-family language similarity for dictionary induction is new. There are a number of open questions. The first is whether there exists a better string transformation algorithm to use in the induction step. One possible area of investigation is to use larger dictionaries and assess how much better stochastic transducers, and distance metrics derived from them, perform with more training data. Another option is to investigate the use of multi-vowel or multi-consonant compounds which better reflect the underlying phonetic units, using an more sophisticated edit distance measure. In this paper, we explore ways of using cognate pairs to create translation lexicons. It is an interesting research question as to whether we can augment these methods with translation probabilities estimated from statistical frequency information gleaned from loosely aligned or unaligned bilingual corpora for non-cognate pairs. Various machine learning techniques, including co-training and mutual bootstrapping, could employ these additional measures in creating better estimates. The techniques presented here are useful for language pairs where an on-line translation lexicon does not already exist, including the large majority of the world's lower-density languages. For language pairs with existing translation lexicons, these methods can help improve coverage, especially for technical vocabulary and other more recent borrowings which are often cognate but frequently missing from existing dictionaries.
