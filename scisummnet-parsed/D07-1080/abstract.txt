We achieved a state of the art performance in statistical machine translation by using a large number of features with an onlinelarge-margin training algorithm. The mil lions of parameters were tuned only on a small development set consisting of less than1K sentences. Experiments on Arabic-to English translation indicated that a modeltrained with sparse binary features outper formed a conventional SMT system with a small number of features.
