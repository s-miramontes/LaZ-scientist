In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks (VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of these networks for word sense disambiguation. Our method brings together two earlier, independent approaches to word sense disambiguation: the use of machine-readable dictionaries and spreading and activation models. The automatic construction of VLNNs enables real-size xperiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in turn provides insight into their behavior and design and can lead to possible improvements.
