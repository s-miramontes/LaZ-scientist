This paper explores methods for generating subjectivity analysis resources in a new language by leveraging on the tools and resources available in English. Given a bridge between English and the selected target language (e.g., a bilingual dictionary or a parallel corpus), the methods can be used to rapidly create tools for subjectivity analysis in the new language.
