In order to respond correctly to a free form factual question given a large collection of texts, one needs to un derstand the question to a level that allows determiningsome of the constraints the question imposes on a pos sible answer. These constraints may include a semantic classification of the sought after answer and may even suggest using different strategies when looking for and verifying a candidate answer. This paper presents a machine learning approach toquestion classification. We learn a hierarchical classifier that is guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of answer types, and eventually classifies questions into finegrained classes. We show accurate results on a large col lection of free-form questions used in TREC 10.
