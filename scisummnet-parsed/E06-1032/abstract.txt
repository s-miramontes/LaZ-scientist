We argue that the machine translation community is overly reliant on the Bleu machine translation evaluation metric. We show that an improved Bleu score is neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving an actual improvement in translation quality, and give two significant counterexamples to Bleuâ€™s correlation with human judgments of quality. This offers new potential for research which was previously deemed unpromising by an inability to improve upon Bleu scores.
