This paper presents an unsupervised method forassembling semantic knowledge from a part-of speech tagged corpus using graph algorithms. The graph model is built by linking pairs of words which participate in particular syntacticrelationships. We focus on the symmetric relationship between pairs of nouns which occur to gether in lists. An incremental cluster-building algorithm using this part of the graph achieves82% accuracy at a lexical acquisition task, evaluated against WordNet classes. The model naturally realises domain and corpus specific am biguities as distinct components in the graph surrounding an ambiguous word.
