An efficient bit-vector-based CKY-style parser for context-free parsing is presented. The parser computes a compact parse forest representation of the complete set of possible analyses forlarge treebank grammars and long input sen tences. The parser uses bit-vector operations to parallelise the basic parsing operations. The parser is particularly useful when all analyses are needed rather than just the most probable one.
