Bilingual word alignment forms the foun dation of most approaches to statisticalmachine translation. Current word align ment methods are predominantly based on generative models. In this paper, we demonstrate a discriminative approachto training simple word alignment mod els that are comparable in accuracy tothe more complex generative models nor mally used. These models have the theadvantages that they are easy to add fea tures to and they allow fast optimization of model parameters using small amounts of annotated data.
