This work investigates the variation in a word?s dis tributionally nearest neighbours with respect to the similarity measure used. We identify one type ofvariation as being the relative frequency of the neighbour words with respect to the frequency of the target word. We then demonstrate a three-way connec tion between relative frequency of similar words, aconcept of distributional gnerality and the seman tic relation of hyponymy. Finally, we consider theimpact that this has on one application of distributional similarity methods (judging the composition ality of collocations).
