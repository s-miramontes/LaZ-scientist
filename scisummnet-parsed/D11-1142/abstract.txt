Open Information Extraction (IE) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary. This paper shows that the output of state-ofthe-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We imthe constraints in the Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative previous extractors such as More than are at precision higherâ€” compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis
