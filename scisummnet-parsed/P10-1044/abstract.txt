computation of preferthe admissible argument values for a relation, is a well-known NLP task with applicability. We present which utilizes LinkLDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) to model selectional preferences. By simultaneously inferring latent topics and topic distributions over relations, the benefits of previous approaches: like traditional classbased approaches, it produces humaninterpretable classes describing each relationâ€™s preferences, but it is competitive with non-class-based methods in predictive power. compare several state-ofthe-art methods achieving an 85% increase in recall at 0.9 precision over mutual information (Erk, 2007). We also evaleffectiveness at filtering improper applications of inference rules, where we show substantial improvement Pantel system (Pantel et al.,
