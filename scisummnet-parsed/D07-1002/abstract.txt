Shallow semantic parsing, the automaticidentification and labeling of sentential constituents, has recently received much attention. Our work examines whether seman tic role information is beneficial to questionanswering. We introduce a general frame work for answer extraction which exploits semantic role annotations in the FrameNetparadigm. We view semantic role assignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph and answer extraction as an instance of graph matching. Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate im provements over state-of-the-art models.
