This paper presents a corpus-based approach to word sense disambiguation that builds an ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers, each of which is based on lexical features that represent coâ€”occurring words in varying sized windows of context. Despite the simplicity of this approach, empirical results disamthe widely studied nouns show that such an ensemble achieves accuracy rivaling the best previously published results.
