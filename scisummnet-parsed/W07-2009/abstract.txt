In this paper we describe the English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval. In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context. The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.Participating systems are free to use any lexical resource. There is a subtask which re quires identifying cases where the word isfunctioning as part of a multiword in the sen tence and detecting what that multiword is.
