Correct translations are shown in bold. Note that in many cases the string-similarity-based orderings of the bridge candidates underperform individual non-string similarity measures, and they consistently underperform the weighted combiof all 8 similarity measures. Note that in the case of correct translation successfully above its quite closely related competitor almost every non-string-based similarity measure in isolation. This behavior (shown quantatively in Figure 8) illustrates the contribution of consensus modeling over this set of diverse similarity measures. Mann, G. and D. Yarowsky, 2001.
