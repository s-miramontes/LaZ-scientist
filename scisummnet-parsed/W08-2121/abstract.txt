The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is accompanied every year by a shared task whose purpose is to promote natural language processing applications and evaluate them in a standard setting. In 2008 the shared task was dedicated to the joint parsing of syntactic and semantic dependencies. This shared task not only unifies the shared tasks of the previous four years under a unique dependency-based formalism, but also extends them significantly: this yearâ€™s syntactic dependencies include more information such as named-entity boundaries; the semantic dependencies model roles of both verbal and nominal predicates. In this paper, we define the shared task and describe how the data sets were created. Furthermore, we report and analyze the results and describe the approaches of the participating systems.
