We examine sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The contributions of this paper are: (1) We introduce POS-specific prior polarity features. (2) We explore the use of a tree kernel to obviate the need for tedious feature engineering. The new features (in conjunction with previously proposed features) and the tree kernel perform approximately at the same level, both outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline.
